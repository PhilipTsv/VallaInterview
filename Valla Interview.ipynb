      " \n",
      " (iii) concentrated exclusively on what income Mr Milne required to survive on the assumption that he retained all of his assets, yet (according to the Commissioner) there were a number of errors inherent in that approach, in that:\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      " (a) if Mr Milne's level of expenditure remained approximately the same, and whether or not he was required to pay the amount due to the Commissioner, then absent the sale of his assets, he would face bankruptcy, yet relief of his income tax liability would not alleviate that plight, but would give preference to other creditors;\n",

      " \n",
      " (i) as to the first ground, being the Tribunal's alleged failure to set out its findings on the issue of whether the applicant was a target for extortion because he was a Buddhist who could pay the moneys demanded whilst Muslims of similar standing would not be targeted, her Honour observed that that complaint concerned 'the conclusion drawn by the Tribunal and not the procedures by which it came to that conclusion' , consequently that ground was not made out and there was no error of law established;\n",
      " (ii) as to the second ground, being the Tribunal's alleged error of law because of an incorrect interpretation of the applicable law or of an incorrect application of that law to the facts as found by the Tribunal; the particulars supplied by the applicant to support that ground referred to the Tribunal's conclusion that the applicant did not face a real chance of persecution for a convention reason because 'he was not a major figure in his place of residence' , and her Honour found that such basis for challenge hence addressed only the factual merits of the Tribunal's findings, and no error of law was demonstrated in so doing;\n",
      " (iii) further as to that second ground, being that the Tribunal erred in its assumption that documents submitted by the applicant were fraudulent and unacceptable as evidence, the Tribunal concluded, and in her Honour's view it was entitled to conclude, that it was obvious 'on the face of the documents' tendered by the applicant that they lacked authenticity;\n",
      " (iv) as to the third ground, it was further open to the Tribunal to make the findings of 30 December 1997 which it did as to an absence of inducement or effectuation by fraud and/or actual bias, and those asserted grounds of fraud and actual bias were therefore not made out; and\n",
